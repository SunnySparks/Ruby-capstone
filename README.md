- Then the program will show you the path of your file and also in which lines there are missing close parentheses

- In case there are no syntax errors in your file, you will get a message like this one, it will show you a message that there are no errors, and also will show you the path to your file

**IMPORTANT** If you wish to rename your file don't forget to change the route to said file, in order to do so just replace the old name for the new one when executing the main.rb file
